Fix row sorting:
  If Season column contains "season":
    Then Season, Team, or Career = 1
  Else If Season column contains "Career":
    Then Season, Team, or Career = 2
  Else:
    Then Season, Team, or Career = 0
  Sort by Season, Team, or Career
  If Season, Team, or Career = 0:
    Then sort by Season
    Then sort by RS/PS (opposite)
  If Season, Team, or Career = 1:
    Then sort by Tm
    Then sort by RS/PS (opposite)
  If Season, Team, or Career = 2:
    Then sort by RS/PS (opposite)
  Delete Season, Team, or Career Column
  
Test on per min, per poss, and advanced
Add rows that contain differences between RS & PS
Use red-green scale to show whether player gets better or worse in PS
Add case if player ID does not exist
Clean up code once it works
