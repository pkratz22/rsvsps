## purpose

I have often heard people discuss that certain players are chokers in the playoffs, but to compare their regular season and post season numbers on basketball-reference is a bit tedious, especially when looking at multiple years

This python file will accept a user ID from basketball-reference (Drazen Petrovic as petrodr01) and then export an excel file that shows their Regular Season, Post-Season, and the differences for each of their seasons, teams, and entire career for per-game, per-minute, per-possession, and advanced stats

I made it so that it works one player at a time, as I know basketball-reference does not want excessive scraping because if too many people do it, it could take a toll on their servers. If you wish to extend upon this to do so, that is up to you but I do not support that. 

If desired, I can add some visualization (color scales, or anything else) rather than just exporting as an excel sheet, but I thought the excel sheet would give people greater flexibility when looking at the data
